## Hi there 👋

I’m Lakshya, a Computer Science student from India.
I love learning new technologies and building projects that solve real-world problems.

I’m currently exploring Web Development, Android (Kotlin), IoT with ESP32 and AWS Cloud.

My main tools are Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, VS Code, and Git.
Recently, I’ve been working on IoT systems, dashboards, and smart automation projects.

Fun Facts:

I prefer working late at night 🌙

I enjoy building things more than planning them

Always learning something new every week
